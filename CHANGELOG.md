### ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: Complete Functional Mining System

This release marks the completion of a fully functional quantum cryptocurrency miner with verified pool integration!

### Added

#### Mining Infrastructure
- **Stratum v1 Protocol Client**: Full implementation with async ASIO networking
  - Connection management with auto-reconnect
  - JSON-RPC message handling (subscribe, authorize, submit)
  - Mining notifications (mining.notify, mining.set_difficulty)
  - Error handling with Stratum error codes
  
- **Work Management System**:
  - `WorkManager`: Job queue management and statistics tracking
  - `JobDispatcher`: Multi-worker job distribution
  - `JobMonitor`: Real-time performance monitoring and statistics
  
- **Share Submission Flow**:
  - Proper Worker â†’ StratumClient â†’ Pool network flow
  - Timestamp (ntime) handling from job data
  - Extranonce2 support (placeholder for future implementation)
  - Pool response tracking and acceptance rate calculation

#### Quantum Mining Implementation
- **QHash Algorithm Worker**:
  - Complete qhash proof-of-work implementation
  - SHA256d (Bitcoin-style double hashing) with OpenSSL EVP API
  - Quantum circuit generation from block header hashes
  - Nonce iteration and share detection
  - Worker statistics (hashrate, shares found)
  
- **Quantum Simulator System**:
  - `IQuantumSimulator`: Abstract interface for quantum backends
  - `CPUSimulator`: Basic CPU implementation with state vector simulation
  - `QuantumCircuit`: Circuit representation with rotation and CNOT gates
  - `SimulatorFactory`: Backend selection and instantiation
  
- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**:
  - Template-based fixed-point class for deterministic calculations
  - Q15 and Q31 types for quantum measurements
  - Cross-platform consensus-critical math operations

#### Bitcoin-Style Features
- **Target Validation**:
  - Proper compact bits format decoding
  - 256-bit target calculation (coefficient * 256^(exponent-3))
  - Big-endian hash comparison
  - Difficulty validation matching Bitcoin protocol

#### Build System
- Modern CMake configuration (3.22+)
- FetchContent dependency management:
  - fmt 10.2.1 (formatting)
  - nlohmann/json 3.11.3 (JSON parsing)
  - cxxopts 3.1.1 (CLI parsing)
  - ASIO 1.28.1 (networking)
- CUDA support with multiple architecture targets (75-90)
- Strict compilation flags (-Wall -Wextra -Werror)

### Changed
- **Removed OpenMP dependency**: Unnecessary for thread-based architecture
- **Updated to OpenSSL EVP API**: Replaced deprecated SHA256 functions
- **Improved error handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery
- **Enhanced logging**: Colored console output with fmt library

### Fixed
- **Share submission to pool**: Corrected flow from local-only to network submission
- **Timestamp handling**: Fixed "ntime out of range" error by using job timestamp
- **Target validation**: Fixed "low difficulty" rejections with proper bits decoding
- **Worker callback flow**: Proper share callback chain to StratumClient

### Performance
- **Current Baseline**: ~1.00 H/s with CPU_BASIC simulator
- **Pool Integration**: Successfully mining on qubitcoin.luckypool.io
- **Share Acceptance**: Verified submission and tracking on live pool

- CUDA 12.0+ (for GPU support)
- OpenSSL (for SHA256d)
- Modern CMake with FetchContent

### Verified Functionality
âœ… Pool connection and authentication  
âœ… Job reception via mining.notify  
âœ… Share generation and submission  
âœ… Worker registration and tracking  
âœ… Real-time statistics monitoring  
âœ… Difficulty handling  
âœ… Error recovery and reconnection  

### Pool Status
```
Worker: R3G
Pool: qubitcoin.luckypool.io:8610
Status: ONLINE
Hashrate: 1.00 H/s (CPU baseline)
Shares: Successfully tracked
```

### Known Limitations
- CPU-only simulation (low hashrate)
- Simplified extranonce2 handling
- No GPU acceleration yet
- Sequential nonce processing

### Next Phase: GPU Implementation
The system is ready for GPU CUDA kernel implementation to achieve 100-1000x performance improvement:
- CUDA kernels for quantum gate operations
- Batched nonce processing (64-128 parallel)
- Memory-optimized state vector operations
- Multi-stream GPU processing
- Advanced optimizations (gate fusion, coalescing)
