# cuQuantum Optimization Summary

Date: 2025-10-31

This file consolidates cuQuantum (custatevec) optimizations, including the latest single-state backend integration and prior batched backend findings.

## Current session findings (feat/gate-fusion)

- Implemented real cuStateVec gate application in `CuQuantumSimulator`:
    - RY, RZ via `custatevecApplyPauliRotation` with correct angle mapping (θ' = -θ/2 for e^{i θ' P})
    - CNOT via controlled-X (single-qubit X with control) using `custatevecApplyMatrix`
- Measurement: deterministic host-side ⟨Z⟩ reduction to Q15
- Sanity/perf harness: `tests/test_cuquantum_backend.cpp`

### 2025-10-31: Batched correctness fix

- Identified a mismatch between single-state and batched results for ⟨Z⟩ on qubits > q0 when using `custatevecApplyMatrixBatched` with `CUSTATEVEC_MATRIX_MAP_TYPE_MATRIX_INDEXED` for per-state RY/RZ.
- Root cause: misuse/ambiguity in the batched matrix-application API parameters (likely map/indexing semantics). With batch=1, results matched; mismatches appeared only for batch>1.
- Fix applied: generate per-state 2×2 rotation matrices on device as before, but apply them using the non-batched `custatevecApplyMatrix` in a loop over states (still on the cuStateVec compute stream). This preserves correctness and maintains overlap for H2D angle copies. The fully batched path is kept behind an internal switch for future optimization once parameterization is clarified with NVIDIA docs/samples.
- Result: `tests/test_cuquantum_batched` now reports `[OK]` for batch=4096 with nq=16; perf is ~0.215 ms/circuit (~4.6 KH/s) including RY/RZ+CNOT.

Next: Revisit `custatevecApplyMatrixBatched` usage (map type, indices pointer location, and matrix layout) to restore the batched rotation speedup without sacrificing correctness.

Added targeted validation for `custatevecApplyPauliRotation` in `tests/test_cuquantum_pauli_rotation.cpp`.

Performance snapshot (16q, 2 layers, 200 runs):

- ApplyMatrix rotations (before): ~0.894 ms/circuit (~1.12 KH/s)
- PauliRotation enabled: ~0.473 ms/circuit (~2.12 KH/s)
- Fused custom CUDA baseline: ~0.47–0.48 ms/circuit (~2.13 KH/s)

Key updates:

1. Eliminated per-gate H2D for RY/RZ by enabling `custatevecApplyPauliRotation` (default ON via CMake option)
2. Fixed angle semantics: cuStateVec applies e^{i θ P}; standard gates are e^{-i θ P/2}. We pass θ' = -θ/2
3. Reusable workspace and dedicated stream already in place (still used for CNOT ApplyMatrix)
4. Next: implement true batched path in `custatevec_batched.cu` using native batched APIs (ApplyMatrixBatched, ComputeExpectationBatched)

## Pitfalls to avoid (historical)

These patterns were observed to be inefficient and should be avoided in the batched implementation:

1) Excessive synchronization (e.g., sync after every gate)

2) Sequential per-state processing instead of letting cuStateVec pipeline work on a single handle/stream

3) Misuse of multiple streams without binding them properly to handles (cuStateVec uses the handle’s stream)

## Research Findings

### cuQuantum Native Batched APIs
Investigated NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK examples and found **native batched functions**:

- ✅ `custatevecMeasureBatched` - Measure multiple states in parallel
- ✅ `custatevecComputeExpectationBatched` - Batch expectation values
- ✅ `custatevecAbs2SumArrayBatched` - Batch probability calculations
- ✅ `custatevecApplyMatrixBatched` - Apply same gate to multiple states
- ❌ **No batched Pauli rotation API** (RY/RZ/RX gates)

### Key Insight
cuQuantum supports batching for **measurements and matrix operations**, but rotation gates must be applied individually. The real bottleneck wasn't lack of batched APIs—it was **synchronization overhead**.

## Batched optimization plan

### Phase 1: Remove per-gate synchronization

**Change**: Moved `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` from inner loop to function end.

```cpp
// AFTER: Single sync at the end
for (each gate in circuit) {
    for (each state in batch) {
        apply_gate_to_state();  // custatevec queues internally
    }
    // No sync here - let custatevec pipeline work
}
cudaDeviceSynchronize();  // ✓ One sync for all operations
```

### Phase 2: Use native batched measurement/expectation APIs

**Before** (sequential measurement):
```cpp
for (int b = 0; b < batch_size_; ++b) {
    void* sv = d_states + b * state_size;
    custatevecComputeExpectationsOnPauliBasis(handle, sv, ...);
}
```

**After** (batched API):
```cpp
// Processes all 128 states in one API call
custatevecComputeExpectationBatched(
    handle_, 
    d_states_,          // All states
    CUDA_C_32F, 
    num_qubits_,
    batch_size_,        // 128 states
    state_size_,        // Stride
    d_expectations_dev, // Output for all states
    d_matrices,         // Pauli-Z operators
    ...
);
```

## Performance impact (expected for batched path)

### Expected improvements

| Metric | Before | After (Expected) | Improvement |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Hashrate | 300-500 H/s | 1,500-2,500 H/s | **3-5×** |
| GPU Utilization | 30-40% | 70-85% | **2×** |
| Sync Overhead | ~300 syncs/iteration | 1 sync/iteration | **300×** |
| Latency/Batch | 300-500 ms | 50-100 ms | **4-5×** |

### Rationale

1. **Synchronization Reduction**: From 300+ syncs to 1 per mining iteration
   - Each sync has ~0.1-1ms overhead → 30-300ms saved per batch
   
2. **GPU Pipeline Utilization**: custatevec can now queue multiple operations before blocking
   - Better memory access patterns
   - More opportunities for async execution

3. **Native Batched Measurement**: Leverages custatevec's optimized implementation
   - Parallel probability calculation across 128 states
   - Single kernel launch instead of 128 sequential calls

## Files modified (this phase)

### `src/quantum/custatevec_backend.cpp`
- Switched Y/Z rotations to `custatevecApplyPauliRotation` with θ' = -θ/2 mapping
- Kept CNOT via ApplyMatrix; reusable workspace and handle-bound stream

### `CMakeLists.txt`
- Added `OHMY_CUQUANTUM_USE_PAULI_ROTATION` option (default ON) and defined macro when cuQuantum is present

### `tests/test_cuquantum_pauli_rotation.cpp`
- New diagnostic verifying PauliRotation correctness and showing a perf smoke for 16 qubits

### Build Status
✅ Compiles cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`  
✅ No runtime errors on initialization  
✅ Successfully connects to mining pool

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Benchmark Hashrate
```bash
# Run miner and measure performance
./build/ohmy-miner --algo qhash \
  --url qubitcoin.luckypool.io:8610 \
  --user <QTC_WALLET>.worker \
  --pass x

# Observe hashrate after 30-60 seconds
# Expected: 1,500-2,500 H/s (vs. previous 300-500 H/s)
```

### 2. Monitor GPU Utilization
```bash
# In separate terminal
nvidia-smi dmon -s u -d 1

# Watch GPU utilization %
# Expected: 70-85% (vs. previous 30-40%)
```

### 3. Profile with Nsight Systems
```bash
nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx -o cuquantum_batch ./build/ohmy-miner ...
# Analyze timeline for:
# - Reduced synchronization stalls
# - Better kernel launch patterns
# - Improved memory throughput
```

## Next steps (focused)

1. Implement `custatevecApplyMatrixBatched` for broadcastable gates and per-state matrices when needed
2. Implement `custatevecComputeExpectationBatched` for ⟨Z⟩ to avoid D2H of full states
3. Validate determinism and correctness vs. current single-state path
4. Profile with Nsight Systems/Compute and iterate on occupancy and bandwidth

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ PauliRotation enabled by default; correctness validated; ~1.9× speedup vs previous cuQuantum path. Batched optimization is the next deliverable.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run live benchmark to measure actual improvement
2. If performance meets target (>1,500 H/s) → optimization successful
3. If below target → implement hybrid custom kernel approach

---

**Note**: The optimization leverages cuQuantum's internal work queuing to enable pipelining without requiring explicit batch APIs for all operations. This is a practical solution given API limitations while still achieving significant performance gains.
